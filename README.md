# ACMCodingDays
Programming Competition that me and my team won against 30 teams (2022)

The competition, hosted by ACM AUTH, featured daily challenges, where each team earned points by solving them correctly and as fast as possible. 
For each day I will be posting the Challenge description and our Python solution.
